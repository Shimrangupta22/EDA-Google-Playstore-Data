# Exploratory Data Analysis on Google Play Store Data

## Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Google Play Store data to uncover trends, patterns, and actionable insights. The analysis aims to understand app performance, user behavior, and market trends by exploring key variables such as ratings, app categories, reviews, installations, and more.

## Objectives
- Analyze and visualize trends in app performance across various categories.
- Identify factors influencing user ratings and app installations.
- Provide actionable insights for app developers and marketers to improve app engagement and user satisfaction.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning:** Addressed missing and inconsistent data values using Python libraries like `pandas` and `NumPy`.
- **Visualization:** Utilized `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` to create insightful plots such as bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps to showcase trends and correlations.
- **Actionable Insights:** Derived insights into the relationship between ratings, reviews, app size, and category performance to guide decision-making.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Explored distribution patterns and identified outliers to enhance data quality and relevance.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries Used:** pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights
- Categories like *Games* and *Entertainment* have the highest user engagement.
- Apps with higher ratings tend to have moderate sizes and frequent updates.
- Free apps dominate the Play Store, with significantly higher installation counts than paid apps.
